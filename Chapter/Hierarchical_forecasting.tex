\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Importance of coherency
	\item Point forecasting
	\item Probabilistic forecasting
\end{itemize}
			

The key macroeconomic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation and monetary policies which are used to study the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole are it self aggregates of various other components.
For example, if we take the GDP growth, it is the aggregate of consumption, government expenditure, investments and net exports. These four components are again aggregates of some sub components. When we collect data for each of these individual variab
les over some time period, we will observe a collection of multiple time series that are bounded with some aggregation constraints. Thus the macroeconomic data are naturally forming cross sectional hierarchical time series.

If the interest is on a single macroeconomic variable along different time granularities, then it can be considered as a temporal hierarchy. For example, suppose we have monthly consumer product index (CPI) of a particular country. The quarterly CPI is then the aggregate of corresponding monthly CPI of each quarter. Similarly the yearly CPI is the aggregate of quarterly CPI of each year. Hence it will form a temporal hierarchy.

Macroeconomic forecasts are crucial for economic and business activities of any economy. Therefore this area of study has a long history in literature. Econometricians have developed various approaches for getting reliable economic forecasts using macroeconomic data. However, the information of aggregation structure in real data is limitedly used in literature. Moreover, having coherent forecasts will help the economists and policy makers for align decision making that impact for the whole economy. Therefore, our focus in this chapter is to introduce hierarchical forecasting methods for macroeconomic forecasting particularly for cross-sectional hierarchical data structures.

Obtaining coherent forecasts are independent from the forecasting models. That means forecasters were given the freedom to use any reliable forecasting method to obtain the forecasts for individual series in the hierarchy. Getting coherent forecasts is a post-processing technique which ensures the aggregation properties are preserved in the forecasts.   \\


\textcolor{red}{briefly discuss the point forecasts as well as probabilistic forecasts in the sense of macroeconomic data  }

\section{Hierarchical time series}\label{sec:Hier ts}

\textcolor{red}{Fix this depending on Section 2} To simplify the introduction of some notation we use the simple two-level hierarchical structure shown in Figure \ref{fig:simple tree}. Denote as $y_{Tot,t}$ the value observed at time $t$ for the most aggregate (Total) series  corresponding to level 0 of the hierarchy. Below level 0, denote as $y_{i,t}$ the value of the series corresponding to node $i$, observed at time $t$. For example, $y_{A,t}$ denotes the $t$th observation of the series corresponding to node A at level 1, $y_{AB,t}$ denotes the $t$th observation of the series corresponding to node AB at level 2, and so on.

      child {node {BC}}
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{A simple two-level hierarchical structure.}
  \label{fig:simple tree}
\end{figure}

Let $\vec{y}_t = (y_{Tot,t},y_{A,t}, y_{B,t},y_{AA,t}, y_{AB,t}, y_{BA,t}, y_{BB,t},y_{BC,t})'$, a vector containing observations across all series of the hierarchy at $t$. Similarly denote as \linebreak $\vec{b}_t = (y_{AA,t}, y_{AB,t}, y_{BA,t}, y_{BB,t}, y_{BC,t})'$ a vector containing observations only for the bottom-level series. In general, $\vec{y}_t\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\vec{b}_t \in \mathbb{R}^m$ where $n$ denotes the number of total series in the structure, $m$ the number of series at the bottom level, and $n>m$ always. In the simple example of Figure \ref{fig:simple tree}, $n=8$ and $m=5$.

Aggregation constraints dictate that $y_{Tot}=y_{A,t}+y_{B,t}=y_{AA,t}+y_{AB,t}+y_{BA,t}+y_{BB,t}+y_{BC,t}$,~ $y_{A,t}=y_{AA,t}+y_{AB,t}$ and $y_{B}=y_{BA,t}+y_{BB,t}+y_{BC,t}$. Hence we can write
\begin{equation}\label{eq:summing matrix}
\vec{y}_t = \vec{Sb}_t,
\end{equation}
where \begin{equation*}
\vec{S} = \begin{pmatrix}
1& 1& 1& 1 & 1 \\
1& 1& 0& 0 & 0\\
0& 0& 1& 1 & 1\\
& \multicolumn{3}{c}{\vec{I}_5} &
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
an $n\times m$ matrix referred to as the \textit{summing matrix} and $\vec{I}_m$ is an $m$-dimensional identity matrix. $\vec{S}$ reflects the linear aggregation constraints and in particular how the bottom-level series aggregate to levels above. Thus, columns of $\vec{S}$ span the linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ for which the aggregation constraints hold. We refer to this as the \textit{coherent subspace} and denote it by $\mathfrak{s}$. Notice that pre-multiplying a vector in $\mathbb{R}^m$ by $\vec{S}$ will result in an $n$-dimensional vector that lies in $\mathfrak{s}$.

\begin{property}
A hierarchical time series has observations that are \textit{coherent}, i.e., $\vec{y}_{t} \in \mathfrak{s}$ for all $t$. We use the term coherent to describe not just $\vec{y}_t$ but any vector in $\mathfrak{s}$.
  \label{def:coherence}
\end{property}


Structures similar to the one portrayed in Figure \ref{fig:simple tree} can be found in macroeconomics for instance in Section~\ref{XXX} we consider the case of GDP and its components.  However, while this motivating example involves aggregation constraints, the mathematical framework that we use can be applied for any general linear constraints, examples of which are ubiquitous in macroeconomics. For instance the trade balance is computed as exports minus imports, while the consumer price index is computed as a weighted average of sub-indices, which are in turn weighted averages of sub-sub-indices and so on.  These structures can also be captured by an appropriately designed $\vec{S}$ matrix.

Another commonly found aggregation structure is what is referred to as a \textit{grouped} structure. 

Another common data structure which can be expressed as in Equation~ , but that is distinct from hierarchical times series is referred to as a grouped time series.

Here there two or more attributes of interest via which the Total can be disaggregated by in a crossed fashion. For example, industrial production may be disaggregated along the lines of geography or sector or both. Figure \ref{fig:simple grouped tree} shows a simple example of such a structure. The Total series disaggregates into $y_{A,t}$ and $y_{B,t}$, but also into $y_{X,t}$ and $y_{Y,t}$, at level 1 of the structure, and then into the bottom-level series, $\vec{b}_t=(y_{AX}, y_{AY}, y_{BX}, y_{BY})'$, and vice versa. Hence, grouped time series do not naturally disaggregate in a unique hierarchical manner. The disaggregating factors are both nested, as was the case with hierarchical time series, but also crossed.

};

\end{figure}

Another important implementation of hierarchical structures are \textit{temporal hierarchies} introduced by \cite{AthEtAl2017}. In this case the aggregation structure spans the time dimension and dictates how higher frequency data (e.g., monthly) are aggregated to lower frequencies. There is a vast literature that studies the effects of temporal aggregation, going back to the seminal work of \cite{ZelMon1971, AmeWu1972, Tia1972, Bre1973} and others such as, \cite{Hot1993, HotCar1993, Mar1999, SilEtAl2008}. The main aim of this work is to find the single most optimum level of aggregation for modelling and forecasting time series. In this literature, the analyses, results (whether theoretical or empirical) and inferences, are extremely heterogeneous, making it very challenging to reach a consensus or some concrete conclusions. For example, \cite{RosSea1995} who study the effect of aggregation on several key macroeconomic variables state, ``Quarterly data do not seem to suffer badly from temporal aggregation distortion, nor are they subject to the construction problems affecting monthly data. They therefore may be the optimal data for econometric analysis.'' A similar conclusion is reached by \cite{NijPal1990}. \cite{SilEtAl2008} consider forecasting French cash state deficit and provide empirical evidence of forecast accuracy gains from forecasting with the aggregate model rather than aggregating forecasts from the disaggregate model.

The vast majority of the literature concentrates on a single level of temporal aggregation \citep[there are some notable exceptions such as,][]{AndEtAl2011,KouEtAl2014}. \cite{AthEtAl2017} show that considering multiple levels of aggregation via temporal hierarchies and implementing forecast reconciliation approaches rather than single level approaches (we discuss these in Sections \ref{sec:single level approaches} and \ref{sec:reconciliation approaches} that follow) results in substantial gains in forecast accuracy across all levels of temporal aggregation.

This is just on example of the benefit of forecast reconciliation to which we now turn out attention to.


\section{Point forecasting}\label{sec:point forecasting}

\begin{definition}
A set of $h$-step ahead forecasts $\tilde{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$, stacked in the same order as $\vec{y}_{t}$ and generated using information up to and including time $T$,
are said to be \textit{coherent} if $\tilde{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T} \in \mathfrak{s}$.
  \label{def:coherence}
\end{definition}

A set of coherent forecasts respect the aggregation constraints across the hierarchy. That is the forecasts of lower level series aggregate up to their corresponding upper level series of the hierarchy and vice versa.

\textcolor{red}{Add the picture here.}
Let us consider the smallest possible hierarchy with two bottom level series, $A$ and $B$ that add up to the top level $Tot$. Suppose $\breve{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$ of this hierarchy is given by $\breve{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T} = [\breve{y}_{Tot,T+h|T},\breve{y}_{A,T+h|T}, \breve{y}_{B,T+h|T}]$. Due to the aggregation structure we have $\breve{y}_{Tot,T+h|T}=\breve{y}_{A,T+h|T}+\breve{y}_{B,T+h|T}$. This implies that, even though  $\breve{\vec{y}}_{Tot,T+h|T} \in \mathbb{R}^3$, the points actually lie in $\mathfrak{s}\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, which is a two dimensional subspace within $\mathbb{R}^3$ space.

\subsection{Single-level approaches}\label{sec:single level approaches}
A common theme across all traditional approaches for forecasting hierarchical structures is that a single-level of aggregation is first selected and forecasts for that level are generated. These are then linearly combined to generate a set of coherent forecasts the rest of the structure.

\subsubsection{Bottom-up}

In the \textit{bottom-up} approach, forecasts for the lowest level series are first generated. These are then aggregated to obtain forecasts for all the other levels of the hierarchy \citep{dunn1976}. In general, this consists of first generating $\hat{\vec{b}}_{T+h|T} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, a set of $h$-step ahead forecasts for the bottom-level series. For the simple hierarchical structure of Figure \ref{fig:simple tree}, $\hat{\vec{b}}_{T+h|T} = (\hat{{y}}_{AA,T+h|T}, \hat{{y}}_{AB,T+h|T}, \hat{{y}}_{BA,T+h|T}, \hat{{y}}_{BB,T+h|T},\hat{{y}}_{BC,T+h|T}),$ where, $\hat{{y}}_{i,T+h|T}$ is the $h$-step ahead forecast of the series corresponding to node $i$. A set of coherent forecasts for the whole hierarchy is then given by,
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:BU}
\tilde{\vec{y}}^{BU}_{T+h|T}=\vec{S\hat{\vec{b}}}_{T+h|T}.
\end{equation*}
Generating bottom-up forecasts has the advantage of no information being lost due to aggregation. However, bottom-level data can potentially be highly volatile or very noisy and therefore challenging to forecast.

\subsubsection{Top-down}

In contrast \textit{top-down} approaches involve first generating forecasts for the most aggregate level and then disaggregating these down the hierarchy. In general, coherent forecasts generated from top-down approaches are given by,
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{\vec{y}}^{TD}_{T+h|T}=\vec{S}\vec{p}\hat{y}_{Tot, T+h|T},
\end{equation*}
where $\vec{p} = (p_1,...,p_m)'$ is an $m$-dimensional vector consisting of a set of proportions which disaggregate the top-level forecast $\hat{y}_{Tot, T+h|T}$ to forecasts for the bottom-level series, hence $\vec{p}\hat{y}_{Tot, T+h|T}=\vec{\hat{\vec{b}}}_{T+h|T}$. These are then aggregated up by the summing matrix $\vec{S}$.

Two commonly used sets of proportions are the \textit{average historical proportions}:
\begin{equation*}
p_j = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{y_{j,t}}{y_{Tot,t}},
\end{equation*}
for $j=1,\ldots,m$, where each $p_j$ reflects the average of the historical proportions of the bottom-level series $y_{j,t}$ over the period $t=1,\ldots,T$ relative to the total aggregate $y_{Tot,t}$, and the \textit{proportions of the historical averages}:
\begin{equation}
p_j = \frac{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}y_{j,t}}{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}y_{Tot,t}},
\end{equation}
where each proportion $p_j$ captures the average historical value of the bottom-level series $y_{j,t}$ relative to the average value of the total aggregate $y_{Tot,t}$.

Both these approaches performed well in \cite{gross1990}. Their most convenient attribute is their simplicity. Generating a set of coherent forecasts involves only modelling and generating forecasts for the most aggregate top-level series. In general, such top-down approaches seem to produce quite reliable forecasts for the aggregate levels and they are useful with low count data. However, a significant disadvantage is the loss of information due to aggregation. Using such top-down approaches, is limited as it does not allow to capture and model individual series characteristics.

\textcolor{red}{Complete this if we decide to leave these in.}

To overcome this limitation, \cite{AthEtAl2009} introduced a new top-down approach which disaggregates the top-level forecasts according to the proportions of forecasts rather than historical proportions and show evidence that this method outperforms the conventional top-down approaches.



\textcolor{red}{This seems to be simply of combination of top and bottom level forecasts. We may drop it. }


This approach is much reliable, since it calculates the proportions as a function of time, rather than using the simple averages in traditional top-down methods.

\subsubsection{Middle-out}
\textcolor{red}{Add middle-out}

As shown by \cite{HynEtAl2011}, top-down methods are adding a bias component to each disaggregate level. Therefore, all these top-down approaches are producing biased forecasts even if the top level base forecasts are unbiased.

A compromise between these two approaches is the middle-out method which entails forecasting each series of a selected middle level in the hierarchy and then forecasting upper levels by the bottom-up method and lower levels by the top-down method.\\
Since this is a hybrid approach of bottom-up and top-down approaches it still remains the limitations of those two.

\subsection{Point forecast reconciliation}\label{sec:reconciliation approaches}

All the traditional approaches discussed so far are limited to only using information from a single-level of aggregation and furthermore ignoring any cross-correlations across levels of a hierarchy. An alternative framework that overcomes these limitations, first proposed by \citet{HynEtAl2011} and implemented by \citet{AthEtAl2009}, is one that involves forecast reconciliation. In a first step ignoring any aggregation constraints, forecasts for all the series across all levels of the hierarchy are generated. We refer to these as \textit{base} forecasts and denote them by $\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$. In general, base forecasts will not be coherent. An example of an exception is when a simple method such as a random walk is used to generate all base forecasts so that the coherent nature of the data is extended to the forecasts.

In a second step, base forecasts are reconciled so that they become coherent. 

ex-post adjustment


This is achieved by projecting the base forecasts $\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$ onto the coherent subspace $\mathfrak{s}$, via a projection matrix $\vec{SG}$, resulting in a set of coherent forecasts $\tilde{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$. More specifically,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:recon}
\tilde{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}=\vec{S}\vec{G}\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{G}$ is an $m\times n$ matrix that maps $\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$ to the $\mathbb{R}^m$ space, producing a set of coherent forecasts for the bottom-level which are in turn mapped to the coherent subspace by the summing matrix $\vec{S}$ as defined in \eqref{eq:summing matrix}. We restrict our attention to projections on $\mathfrak{s}$ in which case $\vec{SGS}=\vec{S}$. This ensures that unbiasedness is preserved, i.e., for a set of unbiased base forecasts reconciled forecasts will also be unbiased.



Note that all single-level approaches discussed so far can also be represented by \eqref{eq:recon} using appropriately designed \vec{G} matrices, however not all of these will be projections. For example, for the bottom-up approach, $\vec{G}=\begin{pmatrix}
\vec{0}_{(m \times n-m)} & \vec{I}_m
\end{pmatrix}$ in which case $\vec{SGS}=\vec{S}$. For the top-down approach $\vec{G}=(\vec{p}~\vec{0}_{(m \times n-1)})$, for which case $\vec{SGS}\ne\vec{S}$.




\subsubsection{OLS reconciliation}

Assume that $\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$ is a set of unbiased base forecasts, i.e., $E_{1:t}(\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T})= E_{1:t}[\vec{y}_{T+h}|\vec{y}_1,...,\vec{y}_T]$, the true mean with the expectation taken over the observed sample up to time $T$. For any $\vec{G}$ such that $\vec{SGS}=\vec{S}$ or equivalently $\vec{SG}=\vec{I}_m$ the resulting coherent forecasts are also unbiased. \textcolor{red}{Can we tie in here this? Can we say: More generally \citep{Gamakumara2018} show that any $\vec{SG}$ that is a projection matrix will result to unbiased coherent forecasts}.

\cite{HynEtAl2011} proposed to  reconcile the unbiased base forecasts through the following regression model.
From \eqref{eq:summing matrix},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:OLS}
\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T} = \vec{S\ubeta}_{T+h|T} + \vec{\varepsilon}_{T+h|T},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\ubeta}_{T+h|T}=E[\vec{b}_{t+h}|\vec{b}_1,.....,\vec{b}_t]$ is the unknown conditional mean of the bottom-level series and $\vec{\varepsilon}_{T+h|T}$ is the coherence or reconciliation error with mean zero and variance $\vec{V}$. The ordinary least squares (OLS) solution leads to the usual projection matrix $\vec{S}(\vec{S}'\vec{S})^{-1}\vec{S}'$, so that a set of coherent forecasts are obtained by,
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}^{\text{OLS}} = \vec{SG}\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}
\end{equation*}
where $\vec{G}=(\vec{S}'\vec{S})^{-1}\vec{S}'$.
In this reconciliation, the base forecasts are orthogonally projected to the coherent subspace $\mathfrak{s}$. Hence the OLS projection minimises the Euclidean distance between $\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$ and $\tilde{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$. The OLS reconciled forecasts are also unbiased since $\vec{SGS}=\vec{S}$. We should note that using a GLS estimator in this context is not possible since $\vec{V}$ is not identifiable as shown by \cite{WicEtAl2019}.

\textcolor{red}{Can we add Tas's picture and talk about optimality in this sense.}
\subsubsection{Optimal MinT reconciliation}

\cite{WicEtAl2019} build a unifying framework for much of the previous literature on forecast reconciliation. 

 and introduce the MinT approach. Assume again that $\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}$ is a set of unbiased base forecasts, i.e., $E_{1:t}(\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T})= E_{1:t}[\vec{y}_{T+h}|\vec{y}_1,...,\vec{y}_T]$, the true mean with the expectation taken over the observed sample up to time $T$.
Let
\begin{equation}\label{eq:base errors}
\hat{\vec{e}}_{T+h|T} = \vec{y}_{T+h|T}-\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}
\end{equation}
denote a set of base forecast errors, with Var$(\hat{\vec{e}}_{T+h|T})=\vec{W}_h$, and
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{\vec{e}}_{T+h|T} = \vec{y}_{T+h|T}-\tilde{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}
\end{equation*} denote a set of coherent forecast errors. Lemma 1 in \cite{WicEtAl2019} shows that for any matrix $\vec{G}$ such that $\vec{S}\vec{G}\vec{S}=\vec{S}$, $\text{Var}(\tilde{\vec{e}}_{T+h|T})=\vec{S}\vec{G}\vec{W}_h\vec{S}'\vec{G}'
$. Furthermore Theorem 1 shows that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:MinT}
\vec{G} = (\vec{S}'{\vec{W}}^{-1}_h\vec{S})^{-1}\vec{S}'{\vec{W}}^{-1}_h
\end{equation}
is the unique solution that minimises the tr$[\vec{S}\vec{G}\vec{W}_h\vec{S}'\vec{G}']$ subject to $\vec{S}\vec{G}\vec{S}=\vec{S}$. Note that unlike the GLS solution to \eqref{eq:OLS}, the MinT solution is a function of $\vec{W}_h$, the variance of the base forecast errors. MinT is optimal in the sense that given a set of unbiased base forecasts, it returns a set of best linear unbiased reconciled forecasts using as $\vec{G}$ the unique solution that minimises the trace (hence MinT) of the variance of the forecast error of the reconciled forecasts. 

A significant advantage of the MinT reconciliation solution is that it is the first to incorporate the full correlation structure of the hierarchy via ${\vec{W}}_{h}$. However, estimating ${\vec{W}}_{h}$ is challenging, especially for $h>1$. Of course setting ${\vec{W}}_{h}=k_h\vec{I}_n$ for all $h$ where $k_h>0$ is a proportionality constant, leads to the OLS solution of \cite{HynEtAl2011}. A disadvantage of this simplifying solution, further to not accounting for the correlations across series, is that the homoscedastic diagonal entries do not account for the scale differences between the levels of the hierarchy due to aggregation. \textcolor{red}{However OLS does well in practice because as discussed it minimises the Euclidean distance and blah blah. Not sure how much we want to say here.}

\citet{WicEtAl2019} present possible alternative estimators for ${\vec{W}}_{h}$ and show that these lead to different $\vec{G}$ matrices. We summarise these below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Set ${\vec{W}}_{h}=\text{diag}(\hat{\vec{W}}_{1})$ for all $h$, where $k_{h} > 0$ and
        $$
        \hat{\vec{W}}_{1} = \frac{1}{t}\sum_{k=1}^{t} \hat{\vec{e}}_{k}\hat{\vec{e}}_{k}'
        $$
        is the unbiased sample estimator of the in-sample one-step-ahead base forecast errors as defined in~\eqref{eq:base errors}. This estimator scales the base forecasts using the variance of the in-sample residuals and is therefore describes and referred to as a WLS estimator.
    \item  Set $\vec{W}_{h}=k_{h}\hat{\vec{W}}_{1}$, for all $h$, where $k_{h} > 0$, the unrestricted sample covariance estimator for $h=1$. Although this is relatively simple to obtain and provides a good solution for small hierarchies, it does not provide reliable results a $m$ grows compared to $t$. We refer to this a the MinT(Sample) estimator.
    \item Set $\vec{W}_{h}=k_{h}\hat{\vec{W}}_{1}^D$, for all $h$, where $k_{h} > 0$, $\hat{\vec{W}}^{D}_{1} = \lambda_{D} \text{diag}(\hat{\vec{W}}_{1}) + (1 - \lambda_{D})\hat{\vec{W}}_{1}$ is a shrinkage estimator with diagonal target, and shrinkage intensity parameter

        $$\hat{\lambda}_{D} = \frac{\sum_{i \ne j}\hat{Var}(\hat{r}_{ij})}{\sum_{i \ne j}\hat{r}_{ij}^2},$$

        %$$\hat{\lambda}_{D} = \frac{\sum_{i \neq j} \widehat{\var(\hat{r}_{ij})}} {\sum_{i \neq j} \hat{r}_{ij}^{2}},$$

        where $\hat{r}_{ij}$ is the $ij$th element of $\hat{\bm{R}}_{1}$, the $1$-step-ahead sample correlation matrix as proposed by \citet{Schafer2005}. Hence, off-diagonal elements of $\hat{\vec{W}}_1$ are shrunk towards zero while diagonal elements (variances) remain unchanged. We refer to this as the MinT(Shrink) estimator.

\section{Hierarchical probabilistic forecasting}

Point forecasts are limited since they provide no indication of uncertainty around the forecast. A richer description of forecast uncertainty can be obtained by providing a ``probabilistic forecasts'', that is a full density for the target of interest. For a review of probabilistic forecasts, and methods for evaluating such forecasts known as {\em scoring rules} see  \citep{Gneiting2014}. In recent years, the use of probabilistic forecasts and their evaluation via scoring rules has become pervasive in macroeconomic forecasting, for example {\color{red} need to find some references that use scoring rules for macro forecasting.  Check Bayesian macro guys like Koop Korobilis, Josh Chan also Mike Smith's work with Shaun Vahey}.

%For example, \citet{McSharry2005} produced probabilistic forecasts for electricity demand, \citet{BenTaieb2017} for smart meter data, \citet{Pinson2009} for wind power generation, and \citet{Gel2004}, \citet{Gneiting2005a} and \citet{Gneiting2005} for various weather variables.

The literature on hierarchical probabilistic forecasting is still an emerging area of interest. %There's is only a few studies in published literature. The uncertainly around $\vec{y}_{T+h|T}$ is referred to as the probabilistic forecasts in hierarchical time series. Due to the aggregation nature of the data, these should also lie in the coherent subspace $\mathfrak{s}$. If so, we call them as coherent probabilistic forecasts.
To the best of our knowledge the first attempt to even define coherence in the setting of probabilistic forecasting is provided by \cite{Taieb2017} who define a coherent forecast in terms of a convolution.  An equivalent definition, provided by \cite{Gamakumara2018} defines a  coherent probabilistic forecast as a probability measure on the coherent subspace $\mathfrak{s}$.  \cite{Gamakumara2018} also generalise the concept of forecast reconciliation to the probabilistic setting.  

\begin{definition} Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a subset\footnote{Strictly speaking $\mathcal{A}$ is a Borel set} of $\mathfrak{s}$ and let $\mathcal{B}$ be all points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are mapped onto  $\mathcal{A}$ after premultiplication by $\bm{S}\bm{G}$. Letting $\hat{\nu}$ be a `base' probabilistic forecast for the full hierarchy, the coherent measure $\tilde{\nu}$ `reconciles' $\hat{\nu}$ if $\tilde{\nu}(\mathcal{A})=\hat{\nu}(\mathcal{B})$ for all $\mathcal{A}$.
\end{definition}

In practice this definition suggests two approaches.  For some parametric distributions, for instance the multivariate normal, it may be possible to derive a reconciled probabilistic forecast analytically.  However, in macroeconomic forecasting, non-standard distributions such as bimodal distribution are often required to take different policy regimes into account {\color{red} worth checking if any (marginal) predictives are bimodal before we include this statement}.  In such cases a non-parametric approach based on bootstrapping in-sample errors proposed \cite{Gamakumara2018} can be used as long as a sample from the predictive distribution is available.  Each of these scenarios is now covered in detail.

\subsection{Probabilistic forecast reconciliation in the Gaussian framework}

%Suppose we have a set of hierarchical time series where each realisation follows a multivariate Guassian distribution. i.e., $\vec{y}_T \sim \mathscr{N}(\vec{\mu}_T, \Sigma_T)$ where both $\vec{\mu}_T$ and $\Sigma_T$ lives in the coherent subspace $\mathfrak{s}$ due to the aggregation structure of the hierarchy. We are interested in estimating the predictive Gaussian distribution of $\vec{Y}_{T+h}| \vec{\mathscr{I}}_T$ where $\vec{\mathscr{I}}_T= \{\vec{y}_1,\vec{y}_2,\dots.,\vec{y}_T\}$, which should also lives in $\mathfrak{s}$. Since Gaussian distributions are uniquely characterised by the first two moments, it is sufficient to have the mean and variance forecasts to get the Gaussian predictive distributions of the hierarchy.

%Assume we have fit the time series models for each series of the hierarchy by considering all the available information. Using these fitted models we can estimate the means and variance forecasts of the hierarchy which are denoted by $\vec{\hat{\mu}}_{T+h}$ and $\hat{\Sigma}_{T+h}$ respectively. Each element in $\vec{\hat{\mu}}_{T+h}$ corresponds to the mean forecast of each series in the hierarchy and these elements are stacked in the same order as $\vec{y}_t$. Similarly $\hat{\Sigma}_{T+h}$ contains variances and covariances of all series in the hierarchy. One can either fit univariate models for each individual series of the hierarchy or fit multivariate models by considering the correlation structure of the series for getting these forecasts. However as long as the aggregation structure is not imposed, it is very unlikely that these forecasts will be coherent. Thus it comes to the point of reconciliation.

In the case where the base forecasts are probabilistic forecasts characterised by elliptical distributions \cite{Gamakumara2018} show that reconciled probabilistic forecasts will also be elliptical.  This is particularly straightforward for the Gaussian distribution which is completely characterised by two moments.  Letting the base probabilistic forecast be $\mathscr{N}(\vec{\hat{y}}_{T+h|T}, \hat{\bm{\Sigma}}_{T+h|T})$, then the reconciled probabilistic forecast will be $\mathscr{N}(\vec{\tilde{y}}_{T+h|T}, \tilde{\bm{\Sigma}}_{T+h|T})$, where,

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rec mean}
\vec{\tilde{y}}_{T+h|T} = \vec{SG}\vec{\hat{y}}_{T+h|T},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rec var}
\tilde{\Sigma}_{T+h|T} = \vec{SG}\hat{\bm{\Sigma}}_{T+h|T}\vec{G'S'}.
\end{equation}

There are several options for obtaining the base probabilistic forecast and in particular the variance covariance matrix $\hat{\bm{\Sigma}}$.  One option is to fit multivariate models level by level or for the hierarchy as a whole leading respectively to a $\hat{\bm \Sigma}$ that is block diagonal or dense.  Another alternative is to fit univariate models for each individual series in which case $\hat{\bm{\Sigma}}$ is a diagonal matrix. Due to the large number of series under investigation here we consider the latter option.  However we emphasise that correlation will enter the probabilistic forecast after reconciliation.  The reconciled probabilistic forecast will ultimately depending on the choice of $\vec{G}$; the same choices of $\vec{G}$ matrices used in section~\ref{sec:point forecasting} are be used here.

{\color{red} Need to check with Puwasala that base forecasts have diagonal sigma hat}

\subsection{Probabilistic forecast reconciliation in the non-parametric framework}

In many applications, including macroeconomic forecasting, it may not reasonable to assume Gaussian predictive distributions. Therefore, non-parametric approaches has been widely used for probabilistic forecasts in different disciplines. For example, ensemble forecasting in weather applications (\cite{Gneiting2005}, \cite{Gneiting2014}, \cite{Gneiting2008}), bootstrap based approaches (\cite{Manzan2008}, \cite{Vilar2013}). {\color{red} Check/replace these references with references that show heavy tails/skewness in macro applications.}

%Non-parametric approaches are also important in hierarchical forecasting as in most applications they have millions of time series which are often difficult to assume parametric distributions. Further, for data with heavy tails, it is often misleading to assume Gaussianity. The algorithm introduced by \cite{Taieb2017} is also a non-parametric approach as it does not make any distributional assumptions. They first generate, a sample from the bottom level predictive distribution, and then aggregate to obtain coherent probabilistic forecasts of the upper levels of the hierarchy. Initially they use MinT algorithm to reconcile the means of the bottom level forecast distributions, and then a copula-based approach is employed to model the dependency structure of the hierarchy. Resulting multi-dimensional distribution is used to generate the empirical forecast distributions for all bottom-level series which are then aggregated to obtain the empirical forecast distribution for the entire hierarchy. Although the means of forecast distributions are reconciled, the predictive distributions were obtained through a bottom-up based approach. Therefore this approach is not a reconciliation method as it does not use all the information from the hierarchy when producing coherent probabilistic forecasts.

%\cite{Jeon2018} is the only existing study that does reconciliation in probabilistic hierarchical forecasts. This method is based on cross-validation and it also does not assume any parametric distributions for predictive densities. However they applied this method particularly for temporal hierarchies.

Due to these concerns, we employ a reconciliation method proposed by \cite{Gamakumara2018} that does not make parametric assumptions about the predictive distribution.  An important result that this method exploits is that applying methods for point forecast reconciliation to the draws from incoherent base predictive distribution results in a sample from the reconciled predictive distribution. This process, is summarised

%In the first step we obtain possible sample paths from the incoherent forecast distributions. This follows by the reconciliation step which projects each sample path to the coherent subspace. These steps will be discussed in detail below.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fit univariate models to each series in the hierarchy over a training set from ${\bm y}_1,\ldots,{\bm y}_T$.
	\item For each series compute $h$-step ahead point forecasts, for all $h$ up to $H$. Collect these into a $n\times H$ matrix $\hat{\bm Y}:=(\hat{\bm{y}}_{T+1|T},\ldots,\hat{\bm{y}}_{T+H|T})$, where $\hat{\bm{y}}_{T+h|T}$ is a $n\times 1$ vector of $h$-step point forecasts for all series in the hierarchy.
	\item Compute one-step ahead in-sample forecasting errors. Collect these into an $n \times T$ matrix ${\hat{\bm E}}=(\hat{\vec{e}}_1,\hat{\vec{e}}_2,.....,\hat{\vec{e}}_T)$, where the $n\times 1$ vector $\hat{\vec{e}}_t={\bm y}_t-\hat{\bm {y}}_{t|t-1}$.  Here, $\hat{\bm {y}}_{t|t-1}$ is a vector of forecasts made for time $t$ using information up to and including $t-1$. Information from $t=1,\dots,T$ will be used to train the model used to form these forecasts.
	\item Block bootstrap from $\hat{\bm{E}}$, that is choose $H$ consecutive columns of $\hat{{\bm E}}$ at random, repeating this process $B$ times.  Denote the $n\times H$ matrix obtained at iteration $b$ as $\hat{{\bm E}}^b$ for b=1,\ldots,B.
	\item For all $b$, compute $\hat{\bm \Upsilon}^b:=\hat{\bm Y}+{\bm \hat{E}}^b$. Each row of $\hat{\bm \Upsilon}^b$ is a sample path of $h$ forecasts for a single series.  Each column of $\hat{\bm \Upsilon}^b$ is a realisation from the joint predictive distribution at a particular horizon.
	\item For each $b=1,\ldots,B$ select the $h^{th}$ column of $\hat{\bm \Upsilon}^b$ and stack these to form a $n\times B$ matrix $\hat{\bm{\Upsilon}}_{T+h|T}$
	\item For a given ${\bm G}$ matrix and for each $h=1,\ldots,H$ compute $\tilde{\bm{\Upsilon}}_{T+h|T}={\bm S}{\bm G}\hat{\bm{\Upsilon}}_{T+h|T}$.   Each column of $\tilde{\bm \Upsilon}_{T+h|T}$ is a realisation from the joint $h$-step ahead reconciled predictive distribution.
\end{enumerate}


{\color{red}Check with Puwasala that this is exactly what she has done.  Notation may need work to bring in line with previous sections.}

%For a given forecast horizon and add these to the point forecasts $\hat{\bm{y}}_{T+1},\ldots,\hat{\bm{y}}_{T+h}$.  Repeating this process for $N$ bootstrap samples and stacking in an $(N \times n)$ gives,

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:19}
%\hat{\vec{Y}}^b_{T+h|T}=\begin{pmatrix}
%\hat{\vec{y}}_{1,T+h|T}^b\\
%\hat{\vec{y}}_{2,T+h|T}^b\\
%\vdots\\
%\hat{\vec{y}}_{N,T+h|T}^b
%\end{pmatrix}.
%\end{equation}



%bootstrapped errors will be incorporated as the error series for simulating future paths. Taking block bootstrapped in-sample errors in generating future paths will implicitly model the dependency structure of the hierarchy. These simulated future sample paths will be then formed in a vector $\hat{\vec{y}}_{T+h|T}^b$ by stacking the sample paths of each node in the same order as $\vec{y}_t$. As such we generate a sample of $N$ future paths for the hierarchy. We can denote this sample by a $(N \times n)$ matrix $\hat{\vec{Y}}^b_{T+h|T}$ where,

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:19}
%\hat{\vec{Y}}^b_{T+h|T}=\begin{pmatrix}
%\hat{\vec{y}}_{1,T+h|T}^b\\
%\hat{\vec{y}}_{2,T+h|T}^b\\
%\vdots\\
%\hat{\vec{y}}_{N,T+h|T}^b
%\end{pmatrix}.
%\end{equation}

%An advantage to this approach is that the dependence structure of the hierarchy as well as serial correlation, are captured through the bootstrapping.  However future paths constructed in this way will not be coherent and thus require reconciliation.

%\subsection*{Step 2: Reconciling future sample paths}

%The second step is to project these sample paths to the coherent subspace. Then we get a set of reconciled future paths which form a possible sample from the reconciled probabilistic forecast distribution. Similar to the projection used in the point forecast reconciliation, we project each sample path through the projection $\vec{SG}$. Then we get,

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:20}
%\tilde{\vec{y}}_{i,T+h}^b = \vec{SG}\hat{\vec{y}}_{i,T+h}^b, \quad i = 1, ..., N
%\end{equation}
%and let
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:21}
%\tilde{\vec{Y}}^b_{T+h|T}=\begin{pmatrix}
%\tilde{\vec{y}}_{1,T+h|T}^b\\
%\tilde{\vec{y}}_{2,T+h|T}^b\\
%\vdots\\
%\tilde{\vec{y}}_{N,T+h|T}^b
%\end{pmatrix}
%\end{equation}
%where, $\tilde{\vec{y}}_{i,T+h}^b \in \mathfrak{s}$ denote a $h$-step-ahead reconciled future paths for $i=1,...,N$. $\tilde{\vec{Y}}^b_{T+h|T}$ form an empirical coherent forecast distribution of the hierarchy that lies in the coherent subspace $\mathfrak{s}$. As we discussed in point forecast reconciliation methods, different estimates of $\vec{G}$ provide alternative estimates of reconciled future paths. We can also obtain bottom-up based future paths by simply aggregating the future paths of bottom level series for their respective upper levels. This is referred to as bottom-up future paths. Even though the bottom-up approach generates coherent probabilistic forecasts, it cannot be considered as a reconciliation method since it use only half of the information.




\section{Evaluation}

In this section we briefly discuss the methods that we use to measure the forecast accuracy of hierarchical forecasts.

\subsection{Point forecast evaluation}

Any existing point forecast evaluation method can be used to evaluate the accuracy of hierarchical point forecast. We are mainly using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) in our empirical application. Mathematical expression for these measures are given below.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:22}
MSE = mean(e^2_{t+h}),
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:23}
 MASE = mean(q_{t+h}),
\end{equation}
where $q_{t+h} = \frac{e_{t+h}}{\frac{1}{T-m}\sum_{j=m+1}^{T}|y_j - y_{j-m}|}$. Further $e_{t+h}$ is the forecast error, which is the difference between forecast and realisation.

MSE is a scaled dependent measure. Therefore to compare series in different scales or with different units, MASE is preferred. For more details on different point forecast accuracy measures refer to \cite{hyndman2018forecasting}.

\subsection{Probabilistic forecast evaluation}

Forecast accuracy of probabilistic forecasts can be evaluated using scoring rules \cite{Gneiting2014}. Scoring rules provides a summary measurement based on the relationship between realisation and the forecast distribution. However, not all scoring rules are applicable for hierarchical probabilistic forecast evaluation. An comprehensive discussion on this can be found in \cite{Gamakumara2018}.

Since the whole forecast distribution of the hierarchy is a multivariate distribution, the forecast accuracy should also be assessed in the multivariate framework. Therefore using multivariate scoring rules is helpful. Energy score \citep{Gneiting2008} and variogram scores \citep{SCHEUERER2015} are the mainly using multivariate scoring rules in hierarchical framework. Further, multivariate log score \citep{Gneiting2007} can also be used for evaluating parametric forecast distributions. The mathematical expressions for these are given table \ref{table:scoringrules}.

\begin{table}[!b]
	\caption{Scoring rules to evaluate multivariate forecast densities. $\breve{\vec{y}}_{T+h}$ and $\breve{\vec{y}}^*_{T+h}$ be two independent random vectors from the coherent forecast distribution $\breve{\vec{F}}$ with the density function $\breve{\vec{f}}(\cdot)$ at time $T+h$ and $\vec{y}_{T+h}$ is the vector of realizations. Further $\breve{Y}_{T+h,i}$ and $\breve{Y}_{T+h,j}$ are $i$th and $j$th components of the vector $\breve{\vec{Y}}_{T+h}$. Moreover, the variogram score is given for order $p$ where, $w_{ij}$ are non-negative weights.}\label{table:scoringrules}
	\centering\small\setstretch{1.3}
	\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{8.1cm}}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Scoring rule}  & \textbf{Expression}           \\
		\midrule
		\text{Log score}       &
		$\text{LS}(\breve{\bm{F}},\bm{y}_{T+h}) = -\log {\breve{\bm{f}}(\bm{y}_{T+h})}$ \\\\[-0.2cm]
		\text{Energy score}    &
		$\text{eS}(\breve{\bm{Y}}_{T+h},\bm{y}_{T+h}) =
		E_{\breve{\bm{F}}}
		\|\breve{\bm{Y}}_{T+h}-\bm{y}_{T+h}\|^\alpha -$ \par\hfill
		$\frac{1}{2}E_{\breve{\bm{F}}}\|\breve{\bm{Y}}_{T+h}-\breve{\bm{Y}}^*_{T+h}\|^\alpha$, \,\, $\alpha \in (0,2]$ \\\\[-0.2cm]
		\text{Variogram score} &
		$\text{VS}(\breve{\bm{F}}, \bm{y}_{T+h}) =
		\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}
		\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}
		w_{ij}\Big(|y_{T+h,i} - y_{T+h,j}|^p -$ \par\hfill
		$E_{\breve{\bm{F}}}|\breve{Y}_{T+h,i}-\breve{Y}_{T+h,j}|^p\Big)^2$ \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Log score is easy to use if the parametric forecast distributions are available. However, \cite{Gamakumara2018} showed that the multivariate log scores are inappropriate for the comparisons between incoherent and coherent forecast distributions. This is due to the degeneracy of multivariate coherent forecast distributions.

Energy score and variogram score can be used in any comparisons between multivariate hierarchical forecast distributions. The expectations in these scoring rules can be approximated by the sample means of simulated samples.

It would be also interested to see the performance of forecast distributions of individual series in the hierarchy. To measure these we use univariate scoring rules such as Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS) and univariate log score \citep{Gneiting2008}. The mathematical expression for CRPS is given by,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:24}
\text{CRPS}(\breve{F}_i,y_{T+h,i}) = E_{\breve{F}_i}|\breve{Y}_{T+h,i}-y_{T+h,i}| - \frac{1}{2}E_{\breve{F}_i}|\breve{Y}_{T+h,i}-\breve{Y}^*_{T+h,i}|,
\end{equation}
where $\breve{Y}_{T+h,i}$ and $\breve{Y}^*_{T+h,i}$ are two independent copies from the $i$th reconciled marginal forecast distribution $\tilde{F}_i$ of the hierarchy and $y_{T+h,i}$ is the $i$th realization from the true marginal distribution $G_i$. As in multivariate scoring rules, the expectations can be approximated by the sample average.

\subsection{Comparison between different forecasting methods}

We are mainly interested to evaluate the hierarchical forecasts in two aspects. One is to examine whether the having coherent forecasts is improving the forecast accuracy. This can be evaluated by comparing the incoherent forecasts with any coherent forecasts in both point as well as probabilistic framework. Secondly we are interested in finding the best reconciliation method by comparing reconciled forecast from different reconciliation methods.

For any comparison we use Skill score as defined in \citep{Gneiting2007}. For a given forecasting method, evaluated by a particular scoring rule $S(\cdot)$ , the skill score can be calculated as follows,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:25}
Ss[S_B(\cdot)] = \frac{S_B(\bm{Y},\bm{y})^{\text{ref}} - S_B(\breve{\bm{Y}},\bm{y})}{S_B(\bm{Y},\bm{y})^{\text{ref}}}\times 100\%,
\end{equation}
where $S_B(\cdot)$ is average score over $B$ replicates and $S_B(\bm{Y},\bm{y})^{\text{ref}}$ is the average score of the reference forecasting methods. Thus $Ss[S_B(\cdot)]$ gives the percentage improvement of the preferred forecasting method relative to the reference method. Any positive value indicates that method is superior to the reference method, whereas any negative value of $Ss[S_B(\cdot)]$ indicate that the method we compared is poor than the reference method.


\section{GDP of Australia}

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), GDP of Australia is measured in three main approaches namely, Production, Income and Expenditure. Each of the three approaches naturally form a hierarchy according to the way data are collected and aggregated. Figures \ref{GDP_P_fig1}, \ref{GDP_I_fig1} and \ref{GDP_E_fig1} depict these hierarchies. In each hierarchy, the most aggregate level is denoted in gray whereas, the most disaggregate level is denoted in red. The intermediate levels are denoted in orange and blue. Levels denoted in orange continues to disaggregate further and these are separately depicted in different tree diagrams. Further, a description of each series in these hierarchies along with the series ID assigned by the ABS is given in the tables \ref{Tab: Income-hierarchy}, \ref{Tab:Expenditure-hierarchy-1}, \ref{Tab:Expenditure-hierarchy-2} and \ref{Tab:Expenditure-hierarchy-3} in appendix 1.
.

GDP and its associated components are generally measured in different price indexes. \textit{Current price value} is one such price index which measures the sum of individual transaction values - quantity produced or sold multiplied by the unit price of a particular period. Alternatively, the production growth irrespective to the price change is measured by holding the price constant at a base year - referred to as \textit{constant price index} or by linking the period-to-period price indexes via an index formula - referred to as \textit{chain volume index} \citep{ABS2015}. Although the current prices are subjective to the changes of price in period-to-period, unlike chain volume indexes, these estimates satisfy the coherency of observed data. Therefore we consider the current prices of all series as the coherency is important in this study.

We use seasonally unadjusted quarterly data ranging from 1984-Q4 to 2018-Q1. Since the current prices of quarterly series are not available for production approach, we consider only the income and expenditure approaches in our study. Further, the current price estimates of GDP is calculated by reflating the average chain volume estimates over three approaches by the implicit price deflator derived from the expenditure-based estimate. As a result, there exist a statistical discrepancy for GDP estimates in each approach \citep{ABS2018}. These were also included in the hierarchy in order to align with the coherency conditions in observed data. Furthermore, adjusting for seasonality in each series will deviate the aggregate constraints of the hierarchy. Thus we use seasonally unadjusted data to preserve coherency.


Following subsections will give a brief description of income and expenditure hierarchies.

\subsection{Income approach}

In the income approach, the GDP is measured by the aggregation of all income flows. That is the aggregation of all factor incomes  and the taxes less subsidies on production and imports at purchaser's price \citep{ABS2015}. Underline equation is given as,
\begin{small}
	\begin{align*}
	GDP(I) &= \textit{Compensation of employees} + \textit{Gross operating surplus} + \textit{Gross mixed income}\\ &+ \textit{Taxes on production and imports} - \textit{Subsidies on production and imports}\\ &+ \textit{Statistical decrepency (I)}\\
	\end{align*}
\end{small}
Hierarchy shown in figure \ref{GDP_I_fig1} in appendix 1 reflects how these are further disaggregated.

\subsection{Expenditure approach}

In the expenditure approach, the GDP is calculated as the aggregation of final consumption expenditure, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), changes in inventories of finished goods, work-in-progress and raw materials and the value of exports less imports of the goods and services \citep{ABS2015}. Underline equation is,

\begin{small}
	\begin{align*}
	GDP(E) &= \textit{Final consumption expenditure} + \textit{Gross fixed capital formation} + \textit{Changes in inventories}\\ &+ \textit{Exports of goods and services} - \textit{Imports of goods and services} + \textit{Statistical decrepency (E)}\\
	\end{align*}
\end{small}
Associated hierarchical structure is given in figure \ref{GDP_E_fig1}, \ref{GDP_E_fig2} and \ref{GDP_E_fig3} in appendix 1.

Income and expenditure hierarchies consist 16 and 81 series respectively. All quarterly data for these series were obtained from the ABS and used to estimate coherent forecasts for Australian GDP along with its disaggregate components. In the following section we describe the hierarchical forecasting methods that we are using to get these forecasts.

\section{Empirical study}

In this empirical study we apply above discussed hierarchical methods to obtain coherent point as well as probabilistic forecasts for Australian GDP from income and expenditure approach along with the forecasts for its disaggregate components.

Let us first observe the time series plots for each approach. Figure \ref{TS-Inc} and \ref{TS-Exp} depicts these plots for income and expenditure hierarchies respectively. The upper panel of each figure shows the time series of all aggregate level series whereas lower panel shows the bottom level series. We can see that different series reflect different characteristics. For example, in the expenditure hierarchy, some series reflects an upward trend while some others reflect a downward trend or no trend at all. Further some series are having seasonal pattern whereas some does not have any seasonality. Moreover the bottom level series reflects some noise level compared to aggregate series in both hierarchies. Therefore, coherent forecasts through traditional methods such as top-down or bottom-up methods would not be accurate as they will ignore part of the information in generating forecasts. Thus forecast reconciliation is important in this empirical study.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Time series plots for each series of expenditure hierarchy.}\label{TS-Exp}
\end{figure}

First step in the reconciliation process is to generate base forecasts in both point and probabilistic frameworks. Thus we fit ETS and ARIMA models for each individual series of the hierarchy by using default settings in forecast package in R software implemented by \citep{Hyndman2018}. We further use seasonal naive forecasts as the benchmark and these are always coherent.

\subsection{Point forecasts and evaluation}

Using the ETS and ARIMA models we generate 4-step ahead incoherent point forecasts. Then these forecasts were reconciled using alternative methods discussed in section (?). We initially use a training set of 40 observations corresponds to the period 1984, Q1 to 1994, Q3 and generate forecasts for next four quarters. Then the process was repeated by expanding the training window by adding one observation ahead. MSE and MASE were calculated over the replications for each series. Skill scores were then calculated by considering the base forecasts as reference method to compare the incoherent vs coherent forecasts. Results are presented in \ref{Tab: Inc_PointF} and \ref{Tab: Exp_PointF} for income and expenditure approaches respectively. \\

\subsection{Probabilistic forecasts and evaluation}

We are also interested to estimate the forecast distributions of GDP and its disaggregate components. For that we use the probabilistic forecasting methods described in section (?).

\subsubsection{Gaussian probabilistic forecasts for Australian GDP}

Under Gaussian assumption, forecast distribution of GDP is limited to estimating means and variances. First we estimate the mean and variance of 4-step ahead incoherent forecast distributions and then these will be reconciled following \ref{eq:rec mean} and \ref{eq:rec var} using alternative estimates for $\vec{G}$. Incoherent point forecasts will be taken as an estimate for the mean of incoherent Gaussian forecast distribution $\hat{\mu}_{T+h}$, where as the covariance of incoherent forecast errors will be taken as an estimate of the incoherent variance $\hat{\Sigma}_{T+h}$. Using an expanding window we repeat the process.

To evaluate the predictive ability of the multivariate Gaussian forecast distributions, we calculate energy score (ES), Variogram score (VS) and multivariate log score (LS) for each replication. Further to see the predictive ability of univariate series, we calculate the CRPS and univariate log scores for marginal Gaussian forecast distributions. Skill scores were then calculated using average scores over replications by taking the scores for incoherent forecasts as reference method. Results are presented in tables \ref{Tab: Inc_ProbGaus_ES_VS}, \ref{Tab: Inc_ProbGaus_LS}, \ref{Tab: Inc_ProbGaus_UnivS} for income approach and \ref{Tab: Exp_ProbGaus_ES_VS}, \ref{Tab: Exp_ProbGaus_LS}, \ref{Tab: Exp_ProbGaus_UnivS} for expenditure approach. \\

\subsubsection{Non-parametric probabilistic forecasts for Australian GDP}

We also estimate the coherent probabilistic forecasts for GDP and its disaggregate components by using the non-parametric bootstrap approach explained in the section (?).
