Writing
  - Data section, e.g. size of hierarchy (George to to finish)
  - Results section (Tas to finish writing up)
  - Intro (George to write up)
  - Conclusion (Tas to write up)

Figures 
 - Base v naive as MSE rather than skill score (Puwasala)
 - Point forecast all MSE results together in a single 4 x 2 plot (Puwasala)
 - Same as above for all MASE (Puwasala)
 - Energy score 2 x 2 plot with Gaussian and Nonpara together and Income and Expenditure together (Puwasala)
 - CRPS same as above GDP series only (Puwasala)
 - Hierarchy graphs fix up font size and possible change orientation (Affan)
 - Hierarchy graphs merge exports and imports into a single 'trade balance' cell (Affan)
